        <p id="1South"><b>Shenandoah National Park -</b><br> Established in 1935 and located in Central Virginia, Shenandoah is a park renowned for its fall beauty with mountain scenery. The park which is fairly remote (at least for the East Coast!) offers some solitude for the hustle and bustle of urban east coast life, and is one of the few National Parks to offer non designated site backpacking. The park also features an old Presidential retreat which functioned as Camp David does now, called Rapidan Camp.</p>

        <p id="1Northeast"><b>Acadia National Park -</b><br> Established in 1916 and located in Eastern Maine, Acadia features the highest point along the Atlantic coastline in America, on the crest of Cadillac Mountain. Acadia is a coastal park offering dramatic views of the Atlantic and the many islands and inlets along the coast of Maine. The vast majority of visitors visit during a two month period during the peak of Summer. Visiting this park during late Spring or early to late Fall can help you avoid the crowds. Acadia is also the only National Park in this region! To put this in perspective, California itself has 9, Alaska has 8, and Utah has 5!

        <p id="1Great-Lakes"><b>Isle Royale National Park -</b><br> Established in 1940 and located in Lake Superior, Isle Royale is technically a part of Michigan, although it is closer to Canada and Minnesota than the Upper Peninsula. Isle Royale features interesting rock formations along its coastline, and Moose native to the island. There are also wolves, many of which were artificially placed on the island to supplement the two remaining wolves on the island as of 2018. This was done to ensure the island's wildlife populations are kept check as they did before the wolves were nearly locally wiped out.

        <p id="1Rockies"><b>Glacier National Park -</b><br> Established in 1910 and located in Northern Montana, Glacier is the United State's only International Peace Park, sharing a boundary with and entrances into Canada and it's Sister Park north of the border-- Waterton National Park. Glacier is known for its mountains and glaciers as has earned the title, Crown of the Continent. The glaciers in the park have been quickly receding since the Industrial Revolution and will soon be permanently gone from the park, visit sooner rather than later!

        <h2 id="Midwest">Midwest</h2>
        <p id="1Midwest"><b>Voyageurs National Park -</b><br> Established in 1975 and located in Northern Minnesota, Voyageurs is a lake park, with the highest concentration of Bald Eagles in the world. The park offers a tour around the park which visits many Eagles nests, almost guaranteeing a sighting. Those with their own boats can use the park's ramp to explore the park and even camp on one of the many islands with some stipulations.

        <p id="1Southwest"><b>Grand Canyon National Park -</b><br> Established in 1919 and located in Northern Arizona the Grand Canyon is one of the most recognizable features in the natural world. Carved by the Colorado River (like Canyonlands in Utah), this park is more than a hole in the ground! It offers stunning views of mountains to the South, which lush forests to the North. Inside the canyon you can actually hike to different areas, the Havasupai hike (which leaves the park itself), leads to an oasis of forest and waterfalls inside the Grand Canyon.

        <h2 id="Utah">Utah</h2>
        <p id="1Utah"><b>Zion National Park -</b><br> Established in 1919 and located in Southwestern Utah, Zion is an oasis in the desert. The Virgin River shaped this canyon, and although throughout most of the year appears little more than a creek, it can create flash floods which wreak havoc on the canyon, destroy structures and roads, and further erode the landscape. This is one of the smallest parks, but also one of the most visited thanks to its proximity to Las Vegas, visiting in the early Spring or late Fall can help you beat the crowds. Utah features 4 other National Parks.

        <h2 id="California">California</h2>
        <p id="1California"><b>Yosemite National Park -</b><br> Established in 1890 and located in Southern California in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Yosemite features massive granite formations, waterfalls, and Sequoias amongst a remarkable mountain range. Yosemite is one of the most visited National Parks in the country, many of which visit during the Summer. The Sierra Nevadas experience heavy snowpack, and strict tire chain requirements are put in place usually in early November. A plan to visit Yosemite in the offseason can be tedious, but the reward is well worth it. California features 8 other National Parks!

        <p id="1Northwest"><b>Crater Lake National Park -</b><br> Established in 1902 and located in South-Central Oregon-- Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the U.S, and one of, if not the cleanest body of water left on Earth thanks to its ultra restrictive regulations regarding the water itself. During the winter the annual snowfall is roughly 43 feet per the Park Service, but the roads are plowed daily in the winter, and the snowfall makes the landscape that much more beautiful.</p>

        <h2 id="Hawaii">Hawaii</h2>
        <p id="1Hawaii"><b>Haleakala National Park - </b><br>Established in 1961 and located on the island of Maui, Haleakala is the remains of a volcano which helped shape the island. The rim of the volcano sits above the cloud line, meaning you can watch the sunrise (or sunset!) above a sea of clouds. Thanks to the near constant cloud cover, and the remote area in the Pacific, the rim of Haleakala offers some of the best stargazing in the world. You can even camp in the crater!</p>

    <div class="container parktext">
        <h2 id="Alaska">Alaska</h2>
        <p id="1Alaska"><b>Denali National Park - </b><br> Established in 1917 and located in Central Alaska, was recently renamed to honor the indigenous tribes name for the mountain. It features Denali, the highest point in North America and remarkable amount of Grizzlies, Elk, and Moose which can be seen from the 4 hour bus tour offered from the visitor's center. Thanks to near constant cloud cover, there is only about a 25% chance to see Denali on any given day-- meaning you could spend a week there and never get a glimpse of the mountain. Sometimes it is all about luck! Alaska features 7 other National Parks-- many can be quite difficult (or expensive) to get to!</p>
