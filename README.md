# Let-Me-Find-Your-Park

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a simple website with Javascript interactivity where the user can select a region, and get my recommendation for a National Park in that area. For additional user functionality, the user can hide the map to get a better view of the background image on the jumbotron, reset to pick another region, or change the background image itself. The website provides a write up about each of the 11 selected parks from the regions using a modal. Since this is quite a javascript heavy website, to add accessibility to the content, I have added a text version of the website clickable from the main nav bar which provides the full write ups without the fluff.

## External Links
I have provided working links to the official National Park webpage and the official Find Your Park site where users can go to find out more about the parks detailed in my short write up. I have also listed my social media information so users can follow me on my journeys. 

## Media Queries
I added media checks to correct image issues at certain breakpoints causing the content to malfunction.

## Other files/projects used.
The SVG map was pulled from Wikicommons *(https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map_(states_only).svg Attributions: Theshibboleth)*

JQuery and Bootstrap were used extensively in this project.

## Accessibility

As stated above, I created a text only version to simplify the site for users who don't want to use JS, or may not be able to.

Creating contrast over photos that are interchangeable proved difficult, I added a shadow to the texts to ensure better readability no matter the background.

For the regions themselves, I tried to select colors that would stand out not just from one another, but from the potential background images as well.

## Design choices

I vastly reduced the size of the images to reduce load times, at a sacrifice of quality. One future improvement I would like to add to the site would be to find a way for the user elect to use the high quality images for the background image if data is not a concern.

Overall I went for a simplistic layout that would not confuse or overwhelm the user in a small webpage that is quickly accessible, with minimal text cluttering the screen. The intent was to provide a visually appealing website with high functionality.
